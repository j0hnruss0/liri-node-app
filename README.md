Week 10: LIRI Search Bot

An easy to use CLI search tool for finding your favorite songs on Spotify, looking for upcoming concerts for bands that play your favorite songs, or even learning more about movies that you have/want to see!

In the command prompt, type in "node liri.js" then one of the following commands:
* "spotify-this-song 'song name'": Search for the top ten tracks off the Spotify API that match that name
* "concert-this 'band name'": Find the most recent concerts around the world headlining your favorite bands
* "movie-this 'movie name'": Get some trivia about movies you want to learn more about. Not too wordy!
